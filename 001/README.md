Citrix Hypervisor formely XenServer is redhat based. There is free distribution called CentOS, if you get some skills with it, it will help you with transition, in case this turns out to be your way. XenServer is closed so you won't install any packages on top of it, xcp-ng will allow you doing it. xe api will help you setting up the infra, or querrying details, same for the XenCenter, Admin Center (xcp-ng), XOA (xcp-ng)<br>
Citrix ADC formely Netscaler is FreeBSD based. There is great online documentation for BSD, never the less on top of that there is logic produced by Citrix who bought this product if I'm not mistaken in 2005 from some skilled guy, who introduced the NetScaler engine. BSD knowledge may help you anyway, never the less there are quirks comming from Citrix. ADC stands with binding, you will bind a lot of objects to make it work.<br>

It will be beneficial to get a bit of storage knowledge about lvm (logical volume manager), zfs (zettabyte file system) in case you plan to setup your own NAS (Network Attached Storage) for the homelab. In case you decide to stick with Microsoft world, Storage Spaces may become your friend.
