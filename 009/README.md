It's like clouds on the sky, tend to change fast, both from the GUI frontend, but also from the API. When you follow the IaC path life will be much easier, transition from old way is tough, but it will hit you anyway, unless @crod is right with his decloudify idea.<br>
Cloud is the mindset. That's it.<br>
